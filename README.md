# OkTyles

[Deutsch](README.de.md) | English

OkTyles is a tile map engine where each cell within the map has its own rotation, collision, and image information. This allows for precise control over each cell and reduces the memory footprint to 32 bits per cell for a compact representation.

## Features

- Each cell contains rotation, collision, and display information.
- Compact storage with only 32 bits per cell.
- Edit the map directly within the engine.
- Move freely between tiles for easy navigation.
- Individual rotation per cell reduces the number of required tiles.
